# StroustroopBook
This repository was create to show my progress in learning the С++.
File structure is the same as in the book.
I will add ready-made solutions tasks and exercises beside chapters 1 and 2.
Third chapter also have some changes because the idea to create a GitHub account did not come to me right away.

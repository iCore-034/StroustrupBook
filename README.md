# StroustrupBook
This repository was create to show my progress in learning the ะก++.
File structure is the same as in the book.
I will add ready-made solutions tasks and exercises beside chapters 1 and 2.
Third chapter also have some changes because the idea to create a GitHub account did not come to me right away.

There is "std_lib_facilities.h" file which needed for training but I don't want to use it. I prefer to use basic libraries and directories however I attach this file to the folder "Chapter 3".
